        <!-- <h2>The History of Daniel Maldonado</h2> -->
        <p>
          Daniel Maldonado is an artist, designer, and musician based in Austin,
          Texas. Obsessing over all things art, music, design, tattoos and
          American football.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many moons ago, Daniel got his start in design creating old school
          punk rock flyers, posters, demo covers and t-shirt designs for his
          local high school band. Nights were spent at Kinko's photocopying,
          cutting, and pasting paper to one another to post gig flyers around
          town.
        </p>
        <p>
          That measly high school local band started to gain popularity and
          eventually started touring. Daniel quickly became not only a band
          member, but the dedicated designer. It wasn't long after Daniel and
          fellow guitar player decided that they could save costs by learning
          and printing their merchandise themselves. They quickly started a
          small Do-It-Yourself print shop and everything was produced in-house.
          At the time, the band was touring almost nine months out of the year
          opening plenty of doors, mingling, and solidifying the reputation of
          the design & print company.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the touring days, Daniel continued slinging ink for a few more
          years before accepting a gig as a silkscreen art pre-press designer
          and art specialist for an online sign company. A few years later,
          Daniel decided to go back to school to earn a degree in Web Design &
          Interactive Media. Working and going to art school full time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual Interface and User Experience Design eventually became his
          focus for web and mobile products. However, the roots of getting dirty
          and doing it yourself creating custom designs, posters, record covers
          and merchandise design still burn inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the passion and side project of Daniel Maldonado, who still
          enjoy's keeping things DIY and offering more abstract design services
          to bands, tattoo artist, and boutiques.
        </p>

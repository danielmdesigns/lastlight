        <!-- <h2>The History of Daniel Maldonado</h2> -->
        <p>
          Daniel Maldonado is a artist and designer based in Austin, Texas.
          Obsessing over all things art, music, design, and football.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel first got his start in design creating old school punk rock
          flyers, posters, demo covers and tshirt designs. These were the nights
          spent at Kinko's photocopying, cutting, and pasting to create one of a
          kind flyers that could then be handed out around town to promote
          upcoming gigs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The band eventually started to tour and gain populatirty, which
          required more merchandise. Eventually, Daniel and fellow guitar player
          decided that they could save costs by learning and printing the merch
          themselves. They quickly started a small DIY print shop. Meanwhile,
          touring opened plenty of doors to meet other bands and promote the
          design & print venture. Of course, we eventually went our seperate
          ways and Daniel ran a print studio for a few years after that until
          deciding to go back to school.
        </p>
        <p>
          During that time, Daniel was working as a silkscreen art pre-press
          designer and art specialist for an online sign company. Working full
          time and going to art school full time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual Interface and User Experience Design eventually became Daniel's
          focus for web and mobile products. However, the roots of good ole DIY
          design and band record covers and merchandise design still fuels
          inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the passion and side project of Daniel Maldonado, who still
          enjoy's keeping things DIY and offering more abstract design services
          to bands, tattoo artist, and boutiques.
        </p>
        <p>
